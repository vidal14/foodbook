## Contenido

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Features and improvements I want to add in the future

- I am not very happy with the amount of JS that I am putting into the web, I have more than 100k of synchronous JS and I want to reduce it. I still have to figure out how. My relationship with JS is love/hate. On the one hand I love everything you can do with it and on the other I hate it because it has a terrible cost on the performance of the page.

- Adding a portfolio system with dynamic pages like the blog.

- Improvements in design and usability.

- Making the web totally accessible from the design to the code.

- Cleaning CSS that I don't use and try to reduce it.

- I criticize a lot Medium but I really like its design and some of its features, in fact I would like to add its famous *clap* button to my website.

- Add comments to each post.

- Add similar posts to the one you've read.
